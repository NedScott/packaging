Tools to build MythTV rpms

NOTE:  With the latest FFmpeg in master (targeted to be version 30) the EL7
       version of libvpx is too old.  The local definition of the centos
       repository includes a COPR reference that will support compilation.
       To install the EL7 RPMs, you will (likely) need to add that COPR
       (or some equivalent) to your system (`yum copr enable gtb/libvpx`)
       before installation.

Examples:

  Build latest fixes/29 for Fedora 28:

    ./BUILD_MYTHTV_RPMS -r /etc/mock/fedora-28-x86_64-rpmfusion_free.cfg fixes/29

  Build latest fixes/29 for centos 7:

    ./BUILD_MYTHTV_RPMS -r build_cfgs/centos-7-x86_64-rpmfusion_free.cfg fixes/29

  Build master for Fedora 28:

    ./BUILD_MYTHTV_RPMS -r /etc/mock/fedora-28-x86_64-rpmfusion_free.cfg master
